# KeyZen Miryoku Edition

## About

This is a fork of [Keyzen by wwwtyro](https://github.com/wwwtyro/keyzen), modified for learning the [Miryoku](https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku) keyboard layout. 

The key sequence focuses on learning the base layer alphas (Colemak, Qwerty, Dvorak...) home row, then gradually introduces keys in the top and bottom rows. Common punctuation and web navigation characters are added to the mix after learning every lowercase letter. Alpha letters and uncommon punctuation marks are added last.

KeyZen automatically adds new characters to the mix as your errors decrease. Click on the character sequence at the top to increase or decrease difficulty.

        - `python3 -m http.server`
    - PHP
